American foreign policy is ostensibly to broker a peace between Mao and Chiang. In reality, America is backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the first time, from a completely fresh perspective.

70 ::: Tim Minchin: So Live (2007) ::: Tim Minchin's live concert captured for this DVD, performed at the Sydney Opera House, in one of the smaller Studio Theatre rooms. This is an intimate show and the vibe within the venue is a little proper, but they do seem to enjoy themselves. Tim's act is a compilation of pieces from his successful stage shows Dark Side and So Rock, combining spoken stand-up routines with hilariously witty musical numbers on the piano - an instrument on which Tim is clearly more than adept. To my mind, Tim's comedic forte combines the 'rock' aspirations of Tenacious D with the supreme wit and cabaret-style musical flair of Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Band. He's a fantastic musician, an intelligent, thought-provoking lyricist and a side-splittingly hilarious showman.
