61, Challenging Heaven (2014) ," In August 1945, at the tail end of WW2, a young GI, a Chinese language expert, is flown over the roof of the world into China. His name is Sidney Rittenberg. Rittenberg is an idealist. On his discharge from the army, he decides to stay on. It's the start of a strange and dangerous adventure. He makes contact with some young Chinese - idealists like himself -- who are working for the revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong and against the military dictatorship of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek. One of these young revolutionaries is a beautiful girl called Yulin. As Civil War looms, Rittenberg gets more and more deeply committed. American foreign policy is ostensibly to broker a peace between Mao and Chiang. In reality, America is backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the first time, from a completely fresh perspective.",august tail end young chinese language expert flown roof world china name sidney rittenberg rittenberg idealist discharge army decides stay start strange dangerous adventure makes contact young chinese idealists like working revolutionary leader mao zedong military dictatorship generalissimo chiang kaishek one young revolutionaries beautiful girl called yulin civil war looms rittenberg gets deeply committed american foreign policy ostensibly broker peace mao chiang reality america backing chiangs utterly corrupt regime belief generalissimo bound win civil war mao also looking west towards america rittenberg becomes directly involved secret overtures dreams becoming bridge america new china nobody washington really listening scenes general marshall president truman see america stumbled yet disastrous foreign policy blunder rittenberg treks north maos base yanan meets mao mao gives job also hooks yulin fall love marry civil war erupts rittenberg yulin mao inflicts defeat defeat chiangs forces america backed wrong horse maos army claims victory generalissimo flees country rittenbergs dream still alive ordered beijing believes moment cruel deception america ignored maos overtures chinese saw choice renew old alliance russians orders moscow rittenberg arrested american spy experiences dark deadly side movement pledged full allegiance nightmare chinese communist penal system stalins death rittenberg released stays china stays yulin true historical fact sidney rittenberg still going strong living witness revolution changed world see movie first time completely fresh perspective, drama
